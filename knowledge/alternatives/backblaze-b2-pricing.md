### How does Backblaze's 3x free egress work?
All Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage users enjoy free data egress (also known as download) up to 3x their average monthly storage amount.

### How accurate are your rate comparisons?
The comparison charts are accurate based on published rates and select assumptions at the time of the publication. Of course, every business’ scenario is a little different so it is wise of you to apply further diligence based on your data set, workflow, and needs.
![expand collapse button](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63d32de856f6323a43a277f2/64b994337348cfabb95e5bae_red-chevron.svg)
### Which is better for me—pay-as-you-go or an annual capacity bundle?
Both services run on the same highly performant platform. Which is better for you will depend on how you wish to operate. Pay-as-you-go is ideal for flexible scaling, monthly billing, or smaller data needs. B2 Reserve is suited for businesses seeking consistent annual billing and larger storage commitments starting at 20TB, often purchased through resellers or integrators.
